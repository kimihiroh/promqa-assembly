    * 1 means the predicted answer is partially correct/wrong (partial match)
    * 2 means the predicted answer is correct (match)
    When multiple gold answers are available (provided as a list), the predicted answer is correct/partially correct if it matches/partially matches with at least one of the gold answers.
